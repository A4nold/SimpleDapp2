Developed a DAPP on the blockchain, the project was bootstrapped using hardhat.js. Hardhat.js
helps to create a smart contract, compile it, test it and deploy the smartcontract to the blo
ckchain. Ethers.js was used to interact with the smart contract on the blockchain and react w
as used for the frontend. What was learnt from this project was the basics of hardhat and ethers,
writing a simple deposit function to deposit ether to our contract, learnt about using ABI's to call
our functions in the react frontend, basics of testing a smart contract, deployed the contract 
on the test network using hardhat, setup metamask and added a test network, used a hardhat node to 
add a new account on the test network, using ether.js was able to connect to my metamask, get my 
greeting and deposit ETH into my smartcontract. My aim in undertaking this project was to learn more about 
the developemt process of smart contracts and DAPP in general.
